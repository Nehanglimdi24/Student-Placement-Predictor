Student Placement Predictor 🎓💼
This project predicts whether a student will get placed or not based on key academic and experience-related attributes.

Dataset 📊
I have used publicly available datasets to train the model:

(i)Dataset 1 (Hugging Face): https://huggingface.co/datasets/Krooz/Campus_Recruitment_CSV                                    (ii)Dataset 2 (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/job-placement-dataset
Features Used for Prediction 🏆
The model considers the following attributes:
✅ CGPA – Cumulative Grade Point Average in college
✅ SSC_Marks – 10th-grade marks
✅ HSC_Marks – 12th-grade marks
✅ Work Experience – Prior industry experience (if any)
✅ Aptitude Test Score – Performance in an aptitude test
